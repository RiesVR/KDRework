You may also not use no-collided props as part of your base defenses and no-collided props in your base cannot be an opaque material/colour. No One-Way Killing Holes / Grenade holes. No One Way props that you can shoot through but the invader cant. No Mazes. No Dead-Ends. If the server is full the Warehouse bases are only for gangs / groups of minimum 4 people."

The spacing between the 2 defence doors need to be able hold 2 raiders. Fading doors need to open with a 0 second delay. You may have 2 sets of fading doors per base. 1 set = 2 props. You may not have more than one keypad or button either side of the door, and each must be clearly identifiable."

Bases must not be disorientating or use invisible props, this includes blackout bases. Bases using the 'Wire' material are allowed as long as they are not disorientating. The entrance to the base must be linear, not a maze designed with dead ends and without the use of zig-zags (so that a raider must move left and right to continue), or anything else designed to unfairly extend access to the base."

            "title": "Raiding/Defence",
            "description": "Bases must be designed in a way where both raiders and defenders can see each other and shoot each other. One-Way props are allowed however both parties of the raid must be able to see each other without any kind of distortion when firing. Shooting windows must be at least the size of the Player Torso, i.e. both need to see head and hips. During a Raid, you're not allowed to edit your base at all. You can not have a ceiling that allows you to shoot from directly above the players head. However, you may still use an elevated shooting position provided your head and hips are visible. Shooting below is allowed but must follow the rule stated above. (No head glitching or unfair angles that conceal your head and upper torso from the raiders perspective). Defenders may shoot directly down the tunnel but must be completely visible at all times and not behind cover."
